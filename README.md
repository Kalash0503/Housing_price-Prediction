Introduction

 This project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the difference between population and profit per city by making an graph for population vs profit per city.


Installation

To run this undertaking, you may need Python three.X set up in your device. Additionally, make certain you have the subsequent libraries established:

Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn



You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb script using Python:








Data

Two dataset used in this project is included in the repository as ex1data1.txt and ex1data2. It contains information about population and city to find answer for population vs profit per city.


Model

The model used for predicting eating place income is primarily based at the Linear Regression algorithm. It is educated on the supplied dataset, leveraging one variable to are expecting earnings for a food truck or eating place. The version has been evaluated for accuracy and performance the use of suitable metrics.


Results

The consequences of this mission will offer insights into the potential profitability of different towns based totally on their respective populations. Additionally, the visualizations generated will offer precious data about the information and the performance of the predictive model.

Contributing
